# odin-landing-page
Project: Landing Page from The Odin Project curriculum in the Flexbox
section of the Foundations course.

This is the second project from The Odin Project curriculum and it consists
of putting into practice the flexbox layout module, with all of the different
properties and values associated with it. The project consists of recreating
a landing page from two images provided, one of which shows the completed web
page whose layout we must recreate from scratch, and the other containing
extra information, such as color and font style information, that will help us
achieve the end result.

All of the different properties of the flexbox layout module will be put into
practice in order to further cement the information that we have learned so far
through the Flexbox section of the curriculum, such as the alignment of the flex
items within their flex container and their flexibility in size.
